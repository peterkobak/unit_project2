| Option 2: IMDB Dataset | IMDB Dataset | [Here](./data/imdb_1000.csv) |

For project two, we have provided two project options:

### Option 1
For this option, students will conduct a basic exploratory data analysis on Chipotle's order data, looking to answer such questions as:
  - How many orders are being made?
  - What is the average price per order?
  - How many different ingredients?

The Chipotle data set is from "The Upshot" column in The New York Times. It was chosen because the data is familiar, real-world, and relevant to many students. It allows students to analyze [the same dataset studied by a data scientist at The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/02/17/upshot/what-do-people-actually-order-at-chipotle.html).

### Option 2
For this option, students will complete a series of exercises exploring [the top-rated movies on IMDB](./data/imdb_1000.csv), an online database of film info and reviews.

In these exercises, students will be looking to answer such questions as:
- What is the average rating per genre?
- How many different actors are in a movie?

The IMDB dataset is a series of scraped data from the [Internet Movie Database website](https://www.imdb.com) that describes top ranking movies, including title, data, duration, content rating, headlining actors, and ranking.

## Project Objectives

For project two, you will complete a series of exercises exploring either [order data from Chipotle](https://github.com/TheUpshot/chipotle), or [the top-rated movies on IMDB](./data/imdb_1000.csv).

For these exercises, you will be conducting basic exploratory data analysis. This process will help you practice your data analysis skills while becoming comfortable with Python (Pandas not required).

## Project Requirements

In a Jupyter Notebook, create working solutions for all of the relevant questions. Your notebook should include:

1. Text for each question, copy and pasted from this file (preferably in markdown).
2. A working solution to each problem.
   - Do not include test, practice, or broken code (*unless you were unable to create a working solution*).
3. Comments for all of your code.
   - In your comments, describe any assumptions you made in order to solve these problems.

4. **Bonus**: In programming (and life), there may be multiple ways to solve a problem. After completing our challenges, go back and see if you can think of any other valid methods!

## Rubric

For all projects, requirements will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, instructors will provide you with feedback on required portions of your project.

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
**3** | _Surpasses our wildest expectations!_

> Note: Scores of `2` mean that a requirement has been completely fulfilled, while `3` is typically reserved for bonus objectives.

## Submission

Your instructor will explain how to submit your assignment. Typically, this is done either by:

 - Creating a repository in your github profile, hosting your materials, and sharing a link with your instructor. [or]
 - Forking the project repository, adding your solutions, and submitting a pull request back to the relevant repo.
